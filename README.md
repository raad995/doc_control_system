Document Control System
This project is a Document Control System designed to securely manage documents and their access permissions within an organization. It allows admins to create, update, and delete documents, as well as assign granular permissions (READ, WRITE, DELETE) to users for controlled document access.

Key Features
Document Management: Create, retrieve, update, and delete documents with metadata such as name, content, file type, and timestamps.

Access Control: Fine-grained permission management to restrict document access based on user roles and permissions.

Batch Access Checks: Efficiently verify user access rights to multiple documents in one request.

Role-Based Authorization: Differentiates between admin users and regular users, enforcing strict security policies.

RESTful API: Fully documented API endpoints for integration with other systems or front-end applications.

Exception Handling: Robust global exception handling for consistent error responses.

Technologies Used
